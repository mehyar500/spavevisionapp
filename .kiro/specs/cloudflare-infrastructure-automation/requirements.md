# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the SpaceVision app's CloudFlare infrastructure management by adding automated deployment pipelines, comprehensive monitoring, and advanced infrastructure-as-code capabilities. The enhancement will provide seamless CI/CD integration, automated rollback mechanisms, and real-time infrastructure health monitoring to ensure reliable deployment and operation of the SpaceVision PWA across multiple environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment pipelines that handle the entire SpaceVision app deployment process, so that I can deploy consistently across development, staging, and production environments without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically build all workspaces (web, worker, shared, scripts, tests) in the correct dependency order
2. WHEN building workspaces THEN the system SHALL validate that shared dependencies are built before dependent workspaces
3. WHEN deployment starts THEN the system SHALL verify all required environment variables and CloudFlare credentials are present
4. IF any required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL halt deployment and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN deploying to staging THEN the system SHALL use staging-specific environment variables and CloudFlare resources
6. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation and use production-specific configurations
7. WHEN deployment completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update DNS records to point to the new deployment
8. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous working deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive infrastructure monitoring and health checks, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL continuously check the health of all CloudFlare services (Workers, Pages, KV, R2, D1)
2. WHEN a service becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts via configured notification channels
3. WHEN performance metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger automated scaling or optimization procedures
4. WHEN errors occur in Workers THEN the system SHALL capture detailed logs and error traces for debugging
5. IF database connections fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
6. WHEN R2 storage usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL send capacity warnings
7. WHEN KV operations experience high latency THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics for analysis
8. WHEN DNS propagation is slow THEN the system SHALL provide status updates on propagation progress

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want infrastructure-as-code capabilities with version control, so that I can manage CloudFlare resources declaratively and track all infrastructure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure configuration changes THEN the system SHALL store all configurations in version-controlled files
2. WHEN applying infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL show a preview of what will be created, modified, or deleted
3. WHEN infrastructure deployment starts THEN the system SHALL create a backup of current state before making changes
4. IF infrastructure deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically restore from the backup
5. WHEN multiple developers work on infrastructure THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicting changes through state locking
6. WHEN infrastructure state drifts from configuration THEN the system SHALL detect and report the differences
7. WHEN rolling back infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL restore to any previous known-good state
8. WHEN infrastructure changes are applied THEN the system SHALL validate that all resources are properly configured

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backup and disaster recovery capabilities, so that I can ensure business continuity and data protection for the SpaceVision app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduled backups run THEN the system SHALL backup all D1 databases, KV namespaces, and R2 bucket configurations
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and completeness
3. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL restore from the most recent valid backup
4. IF primary region fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup regions
5. WHEN failover occurs THEN the system SHALL update DNS records to point to the backup region
6. WHEN primary region recovers THEN the system SHALL provide options for failback with data synchronization
7. WHEN backup retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old backups
8. WHEN restore operations complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all services are functioning correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced debugging and troubleshooting tools, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in the SpaceVision app across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide real-time log streaming from all Workers and Pages
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture full stack traces and request context
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide detailed timing and resource usage metrics
4. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL allow filtering logs by time range, severity, and component
5. IF Workers are experiencing high latency THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks in the execution path
6. WHEN KV or R2 operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested fixes
7. WHEN DNS issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide tools to test and validate DNS configuration
8. WHEN troubleshooting distributed issues THEN the system SHALL correlate logs across all services using trace IDs
